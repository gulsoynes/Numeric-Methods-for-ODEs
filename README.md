# Numeric-Methods-for-ODEs
This project is prepared as part of Computer Application in Engineering course and it contains algoritms for solution of ODEs. For detail information please read the REPORT1.pdf and REPORT2.pdf files

For 1st Order ODEs:

1)Modified-Euler Method, 
2)4th Order Runge-Kutta Method, 
3)Third-Order Adams-Bashforth Method

For 2nd Order ODEs:

1) 4th Order Runge-Kutta Method
